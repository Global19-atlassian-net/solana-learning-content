# Solana Community Learning Content

In an attempt to produce meaningful resources to distribute to the Solana community, the Solana Foundation is implementing a community learning fund to commission blog posts, videos, and other learning materials related to building on the Solana network. This repository will be used to organize commissions, host resources relevant to the production of materials, and offer a place to submit content.

## Introduction

Solana is the fastest, low-fee, censorship-resistant blockchain designed to enable developers to permissionlessly build and scale applications to billions of users globally. 

The Solana team set out to create the most performant general purpose blockchain. This starts with an application experience on par with web2 and will quickly be eclipsed as more applications, features, and tools come online. To do so meant assembling a founding team and leadership with decades of experience from top innovation platforms like Qualcomm, Intel, Google, and CERN. This is the same talent who built the technology that allows for massive amounts of data on mobile phones to transmit seamlessly across a high trafficked network and is what led the Solana founding team to solve for blockchain scalability.

Solana doesn’t believe in one chain to rule them all. By creating the right features and tools for smooth interoperability, teams and projects native to other chains can benefit from the Solana network.

Wormhole is a bidirectional bridge across the ERC20 to SPL token standards. Dapp teams can employ Wormhole to move locked value on the Ethereum chain and access the high-speed, low-cost benefits of the Solana network. Read more about the bridge and watch the demo here.

## Video Production Guidelines

#### Delivery

Please use the following file naming format, as appropriate:

`VideoTitle-Username-Type.mp4`
e.g., HelloWorld-rmshea-FullVideo.mp4

#### Video + Captions

Video resolution must be at least 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4K (3840 × 2160). We request a still image that is at least 3840 × 2160 pixels to use as a cover image for the video. Convert assets from the highest quality master possible. Example: If your content was recorded in HD, you should deliver the HD content. But if your content is 4K, deliver the 4K content. Don't convert HD content to 4K, just for the purpose of making it 4K.

Please provide your video in the H.264 video codec, or in QuickTime.

You are responsible for providing captions, and we prefer the .srt format. You may use your own tools for adding closed captioning, a paid professional service, or free tools such as the one available through YouTube. The closed captions should identify the speakers each time they speak, and be free from spelling errors. Captions must be delivered in a separate file—embedded subtitles in video will be ignored.

#### Audio

For best audio, connect an external microphone. The internal mic on your device may not be the best quality and may sound tinny and hollow. A higher quality external mic will have a better pickup pattern and range.
