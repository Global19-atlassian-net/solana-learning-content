# Solana Community Learning Content

In an attempt to produce meaningful resources to distribute to the Solana community, the Solana Foundation is implementing a community learning fund to commission blog posts, videos, and other learning materials related to building on the Solana network. This repository will be used to organize commissions, host resources relevant to the production of materials, and offer a place to submit content.

## Introduction

Solana is the fastest, low-fee, censorship-resistant blockchain designed to enable developers to permissionlessly build and scale applications to billions of users globally. 

The Solana team set out to create the most performant general purpose blockchain. This starts with an application experience on par with web2 and will quickly be eclipsed as more applications, features, and tools come online. To do so meant assembling a founding team and leadership with decades of experience from top innovation platforms like Qualcomm, Intel, Google, and CERN. This is the same talent who built the technology that allows for massive amounts of data on mobile phones to transmit seamlessly across a high trafficked network and is what led the Solana founding team to solve for blockchain scalability.

Solana doesn’t believe in one chain to rule them all. By creating the right features and tools for smooth interoperability, teams and projects native to other chains can benefit from the Solana network.

Wormhole is a bidirectional bridge across the ERC20 to SPL token standards. Dapp teams can employ Wormhole to move locked value on the Ethereum chain and access the high-speed, low-cost benefits of the Solana network. Read more about the bridge and watch the demo here.
